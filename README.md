## MBDI Blockchain Course Repository

This repository contains the materials for the MBDI course on Blockchain.

**Course Structure:**

The course is divided into sessions, with each session focusing on a specific topic. Currently, the repository includes materials for Sessions 6, 7 and 8.

**Session 6: Dealing with Smart Contracts**

The files for Session 7 are not currently uploaded. However, the session title suggests this session will cover smart contracts, a fundamental concept in blockchain technology. 

**Session 7: Frog Game**

Session 8 explores blockchain through a Frog Game example. The repository includes two subfolders:

* **SESSION_8_FrogGame_noBlockchain:** This folder likely contains the materials for building a non-blockchain version of the Frog Game.
* **SESSION_8_FrogGame_withBlockchain:** This folder likely contains the materials for building the Frog Game using blockchain technology.  

**Session 8: Deploying a Bootstrap Website with Login using Metamask Crypto Wallet**

* **grayscale_with_metamask_login.zip:** This file is a compressed archive containing a modified Bootstrap website deployed on PythonAnywhere. The website implements a login functionality using the MetaMask Web3 wallet library, suggesting interaction with a blockchain application.

**Live Demo:**

**Original Grayscale Theme:**

The base HTML and Bootstrap code for the grayscale website originates from the free "Grayscale" theme by Start Bootstrap. You can find the original theme here: [https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale)
